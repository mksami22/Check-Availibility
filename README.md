# Check-Availibility
## Aim
We often come across many products of our interest that are not avaiable for in store pickup. We tend to keep on checking the website again and again in order to check the availibility. In order to solve this problem I have written this code which checks the website for the product every hour and sends the availibility status on the desired slack platform. The code also tags you while sending the message if the product is available.
